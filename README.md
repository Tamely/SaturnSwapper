The source on the swapper is 100% complete which means you can build it without any extra steps. To do this:
1. Turn off your antivirus because the swapper is flagged as a virus due to false positives with WebView2 (You have the source so you know it isn't a virus).

    git clone https://github.com/Tamely/SaturnSwapper
    cd SaturnSwapper
    ```

    Project("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}") = "SaturnBot", "SaturnBot\SaturnBot.csproj", "{9B658498-B58B-4DB5-B275-4BFB59FAD1AD}"
    EndProject
    ```
