# Saturn
This branch contains the code (albeit not clean considering I was never planning on making it open source) to build the last official/supported version of Saturn V3. This includes, but is not limited to, the file provider, plugin scripting language, plugin web API, and the item generators.

## What is Saturn?
Saturn is the most advanced Unreal Engine modding tool. We natively ship with the ability to mod Fortnite - as that is the most popular Unreal Engine game at the moment - but will provide help for modifying it towards another game. The UI is made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combining the smooth navigation of a website with the benefits of a native app.

Official Get-Started Page: NOT AVAILABLE YET
